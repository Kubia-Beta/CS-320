# CS-320
A work-in-progress repository for CS-320, a class I am still taking as of the writing of this document. This will contain the code for a mobile app that is requested by a mock customer.

These files are meant to demonstrate the importance of full test coverage, and the deliberate avoidance of magic numbers in published code, along with clear and concise comments in readable code. It is designed to be high quality, as to keep its maintainability high.
